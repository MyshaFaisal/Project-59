            My Hobby is Art and Craft. Art and crafts help young children explore and express their emotions, share how they relate to their family and friends, talk about their difficulties, their future dreams and aspirations, even if they have not yet developed a full vocabulary to do so. It also develops courage and a healthy self-esteem. Crafting is very enjoyable for me because I make things that I can be proud of. Also, you can have fun by thinking of what to make and while you are making it. I get ideas from the places I go and what I look at. ... This is why I like to craft.
            Types of crafts
            Ceramics and glass crafts.
            Fiber and textile crafts.
            Flower crafts.

            Houseware.
            Fashion.
            Needlework.

        My inspiration was from Tonny Art and Craft. Tonny's got 2.5 million subscribers on her channel! When I started to watch her videos, I thought that I can also make videos on art and craft and that's how I started to do so.I started to make craft and uploaded their videos on my channel which is Craft by Mysha. When I got likes on my videos, I was amazed. I startesd to work hard after that and now I have reached 384 subscribers! That's a big thing for me.
